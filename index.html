<p>While working on my projects, I'm often (or better to say most of the time) searching for answers to (common?) problems on the net, coming across better and worse blogs, sites, GitHub repositories and more. After reading through them and tweak their suggestions and step-by-step guides to my needs, in more then 89% the steps and/or guides are not working with my setup/dev tools or even do not work at all.</p>

<p>Therefore I thought of starting my own blog and write about how I solved certain problems with my setup (it seems that I'm one of the least 10% of web developers who work on a Windows machine rather than this fancy Apple machines) and keep this as a reminder. Also, I hope to get a better (web) developer as I write this blog and have to do some more research on the topics ;).</p>
